These Terms do not apply to the Conflux open source client software or the Conflux distributed open source global network accessed through that software (collectively, “Conflux Protocol”), which may be accessed via our Site. As further described in Section 4 (Assumption of Risk with Conflux), Conflux does not own or control Conflux Protocol and you are solely responsible for your use of Conflux Protocol. Additionally, these Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Conflux for products, services or otherwise.</p>
				<p>Conflux reserves the right to change or modify the terms and conditions contained in these Terms or any policy or guideline of the Site, at any time and in its sole discretion. We will provide notice of these changes by posting the revised Terms to the Site and changing the Last Revised date at the top of the Terms, or by providing other means of notice as Conflux will determine each time in its sole discretion. Using a particular form of notice in some instances does not obligate us to use the same form in other instances. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to the Site and will apply to your subsequent use of the Site. You waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued use of this Site will confirm your acceptance of such changes or modifications; therefore, you should review the Terms and applicable policies whenever you use the Site to understand the terms that apply to such use.

				<p>Unless otherwise indicated on the Site, the Site and all content and other materials on the Site, including, without limitation, the Conflux logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, data, software, sound files, other files and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, “Conflux Materials”) are the proprietary property of Conflux or its licensors or users and are protected by the U.S. and international copyright laws.

			</div>
			<div class="terms">
				<h3>6. USER CONTENT</h3>
				<p>The Site includes interactive areas or services (“Interactive Areas”) in which you or other users may create, post, send or store ads, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, video, graphics, applications, code, links or other items or content on the Site (“User Content”).

				<p>a. User Content that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent, false, misleading or otherwise objectionable;
					</br>b. User Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;
					</br>c. User Content that may impinge upon the publicity, privacy or data protection rights of others, including pictures or information about another individual where you have not obtained such individual’s consent;
					</br>d. User Content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party. By posting any User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such User Content;

				<p>If you become aware of User Content that you believe violates these Terms, you may report it by emailing terms@conflux-chain.org. Enforcement of the Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these Terms do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation or promise that the Site will not contain any content that is prohibited by the Terms. Although Conflux has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User Content posted on the Site, Conflux reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any User Content posted or stored on the Site at any time and for any reason without notice, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Site at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Site in violation of these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Site.</p>
				<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Site or in a separate agreement, Conflux claims no ownership or control over any User Content. However, if you post User Content to the Site, you grant Conflux a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content on our websites and on third-party sites. This license will terminate when you remove your User Content, except that the license will continue with respect to any offsite uses that have already been made and any cached or archived uses that may still exist when User Content is removed. By posting User Content, you hereby release Conflux and its agents and employees from any claims that such use, as authorized above, violates any of your rights and you understand that you will not be entitled to any additional compensation for any use of your User Content.</p>
				<p>By posting User Content to the Site, you represent and warrant that: (a) such User Content is non-confidential; (b) you own and control all of the rights to the User Content or you otherwise have the right to post and use such User Content and to grant the rights to Conflux that you grant in these Terms; (c) the User Content is accurate and not misleading or harmful in any manner; and (d) the User Content, and your use and posting thereof in connection with this Site, does not, and will not, violate these Terms or any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>

				<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED TERMS IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
				<h3>15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
				<p>IN NO EVENT WILL CONFLUX, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, THE CONFLUX MATERIALS OR THE CONTENT OR THE MATERIALS CONTAINED IN OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE BY USER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM CONFLUX, OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR EMAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFLUX’S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SITE.

				<h3>17. ARBITRATION</h3>
				<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH CONFLUX AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and Conflux agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Site, except that you and Conflux are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Conflux agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if Conflux is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above are found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">

			</div>
			<div class="terms">
				<h3>20. SEVERABILITY</h3>
				<p>If any provision of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
